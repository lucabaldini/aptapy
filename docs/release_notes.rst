Release notes
=============


Version 0.12.0 (2025-10-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added support for subtracting callable models from ``Histogram1d`` objects
  (this is useful, e.g., to create a residual histogram wrt a fit model).
* Introduced ``subplot_vstack()`` and ``residual_axes()`` functions for
  creating multi-panel plots.
* Enhanced the ``fit()`` method to support excluding intervals when xmin > xmax.
* Improved histogram copying functionality to allow optional relabeling.
* Updated documentation and example gallery.
* Pull requests merged and issues closed:

  - https://github.com/lucabaldini/aptapy/pull/32
  - https://github.com/lucabaldini/aptapy/issues/30


Version 0.11.0 (2025-10-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New mechanism for matplotlib style management in the plotting module.
* Replace the ``configure()`` function with ``apply_stylesheet()`` and ``stylesheet_context()``
  context manager for better control over style application.
* Shipping a custom dark theme and bundling the Humor Sans font for xkcd-style
  stylesheet.
* Dependencies on ``cycler`` and ``loguru`` packages removed.
* Pull requests merged and issues closed:

  - https://github.com/lucabaldini/aptapy/pull/31
  - https://github.com/lucabaldini/aptapy/issues/27


Version 0.10.2 (2025-10-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default vertical alignment for the text in the ``ConstrainedTextMarker`` class changed
  from "center" to "bottom" to avoid overlapping with the underlying trajectory for
  nearly horizontal data sets.
* Fixed a bug in the interactive cursor logic triggered by mouse events outside the axes
  area.
* Fixed random seed in tests/test_hist.py to ensure consistent results across runs.
* Added a --interactive option to pytest to allow keeping matplotlib figures open
  after test execution for interactive inspection.

Version 0.10.0 (2025-10-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New ``AbstractPlottable`` base class with standard ``plot()`` and abstract ``_render()``
  methods.

  well as all fit models, to inherit from ``AbstractPlottable``.
* Simplified plotting range management for fit models.
* Example gallery revamped.

  when trajectory calculations fail (e.g., when extrapolating outside data range).
* Enhanced StripChart.spline() to support configurable extrapolation behavior
  via the ext parameter.
* Refactored last_line_color() to accept an optional axes parameter, improving
  reusability and eliminating redundant plt.gca() calls.
